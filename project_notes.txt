Project Goal: Build a ML model to identify SN in gravitational lenses

*** --> Question for Dr. Holwerda in next meeting

Analysis:
    1. Obtain single pixel, 30min cadence TESS lightcurves
    2. Analyze these lightcurves to search for possible SN
    3. Use unsupervised ML technique (k-means clustering?) to identify lenses
    4. If time permits, perhaps use CM's code for flare simulation to run a supervised ML technique to identify flares in our data
    
    
(1.):
    -Example notebook:
        https://github.com/spacetelescope/notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/MAST/TESS/beginner_tour_lc_tp/beginner_tour_lc_tp.ipynb
    -Obtain data via TESSCut:
        https://mast.stsci.edu/tesscut/
    ***
    -Which pixel frame do we want to display in our results? See notebook 2. -- integrate over the whole stack
    -Do we actually want single-pixel images, or maybe a 3x3 so we can see the surrounding events also? -- 5x5
    -We are using different data than that of the example notebook above... Do we have the data that we wanted? -- yes, but need        30min cadence
    -Time bins?? See notebook 1. -- links in TESSCut
    -Do we care about aperture optimization or do we just want to use the whole pixel? (Example notebook adjusts aperture for LC)      --nope
    ***
    
(2.):
    -Lightcurve folding?
    
(3.):
    -Literature search for other groups that have done similar work!
        -What method is best (k-means clustering or something else?) ?
        -Are there other techniques we have not considered?
    -Look through .ipynb's from PHYS650 for a review on how to implement these techniques
    
    
Misc. Notes:
    -read into HDU formatting/usage (STScI or astropy.io)
    - cadence =? integration time
