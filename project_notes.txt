Project Goal: Build a ML model to identify SN in gravitational lenses

*** --> Question for Dr. Holwerda in next meeting

Analysis:
    1. Obtain single pixel, 30min cadence TESS lightcurves
    2. Analyze these lightcurves to search for possible SN
    3. Use unsupervised ML technique (k-means clustering?) to identify lenses
    
    
(1.):
    -use lightkurve python package to obtain lightcurves (see email from Scott Fleming on 10/1)
    -Confirm with Dr. Holwerda: Is this the data we want? ***
    -Do we also want the images, or just the lightcurve data? ***
    -10/11 : lightkurve is failing to find data for any of the confirmed lenses, but is working for some other objects. Need to continue to troubleshoot this
    -Some of the data in the tutorial looks rough, may have to apply a smoothing function...
    
(2.):
    -Lightcurve folding?
    
(3.):
    -Literature search for other groups that have done similar work!
        -What method is best (k-means clustering or something else?) ?
        -Are there other techniques we have not considered?
    -Look through .ipynb's from PHYS650 for a review on how to implement these techniques
