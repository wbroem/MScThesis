# MScThesis
This is the repository for my MSc thesis project, under the mentorship of Dr. Benne Holwerda at the University of Louisville. The goal of this project is to apply machine learning to 30min TESS lightcurves in order to identify gravitational lenses. 
I hope to make the project entirely reproducible using the code in the file msc_tools.py and some of the code in the Implement_ML notebook. The TESS data that was obtained from MAST is not stored in this repository since it is nearly 4GB in total. If you want to obtain the same data set, open a python environment and run:

msc_tools.get_all_mast_data()

in the directory that you want the data stored in.
